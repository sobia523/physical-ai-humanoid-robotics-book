## Key Constraints
- Do NOT delete or modify existing modules or chapters
- Do NOT add new modules, pages, or features
- Do NOT rewrite documentation content
- UI, theme, layout, and navigation ONLY

### Light Mode Theme
- Background (primary): #FFFFFF
- Background (secondary sections/cards): #F8FAFC
- Text (primary): #0F172A
- Text (secondary): #475569
- Border color: #E2E8F0
- Accent / Primary action: #2563EB
- Accent hover: #1D4ED8
- Card hover background: #F1F5F9
- Shadow: soft, low opacity, used sparingly

### Dark Mode Theme
- Background (primary): #0B1120

## Homepage Requirements
- H1: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"
- H2: "Embodied Intelligence for the Real World"
- Supporting paragraph: Describe book's focus on Physical AI, humanoid systems, ROS 2, simulation, perception, planning, and real-world deployment
- Primary CTA: "Start Reading" button using accent color, navigates to Module 1

## Module Navigation Requirements
- Display existing modules (Module 1–4) as cards
- Each card: title (module name) and one-line description from existing content
- Hover effect: subtle background change + border highlight
- Click: opens respective module index
- Responsive grid: Desktop (2 columns), Tablet (2 columns), Mobile (1 column)

## Current Implementation Status
- All technical requirements researched and validated
- No "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items remaining
- Ready to proceed to implementation phase
- Implementation plan with 4 phases defined and ready for execution

## Next Steps
- Begin Phase 2: Implementation following the detailed plan
- Start with setup and configuration tasks
- Proceed through component implementation in sequence
- Follow testing and validation procedures
- Complete deployment and documentation
