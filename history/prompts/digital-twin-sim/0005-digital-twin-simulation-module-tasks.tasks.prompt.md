# Digital Twin Simulation Module Tasks

## Context
User requested implementation tasks for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) for the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This task breakdown follows the phased approach with user stories organized by priority and includes all necessary setup, foundational, and content development tasks.

## Prompt
$ARGUMENTS

## Response
Created comprehensive task breakdown for digital twin simulation module with 8 phases: Setup, Foundational, and 5 user stories corresponding to the 5 chapters, plus a final polish phase. Tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Includes dependencies and parallel execution opportunities.

## Outcome Impact
Successfully created detailed implementation roadmap with 80+ specific tasks organized by user story for independent implementation and testing.

## Tests Summary
none

## Files Summary
- specs/001-digital-twin-sim/tasks.md: Complete task breakdown with 8 phases and 82 specific tasks

## Next Prompts
/sp.analyze - to validate consistency across specification artifacts
/sp.implement - to execute the implementation tasks

## Reflection Note
Tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing, with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.

## Failure Modes Observed
None
