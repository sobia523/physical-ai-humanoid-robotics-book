# Prompt History Record: Docusaurus UI Planning Completion

## Summary

This PHR documents the completion of the planning phase for the Professional Docusaurus UI System for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. The planning includes comprehensive research, data modeling, API contracts, and implementation plan to deliver a modern, academic, and professional UI/UX while preserving all existing content.

## Original Prompt

```
/sp.plan

Project: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — UI & Theme Execution Plan
```

## Response Summary

Successfully completed the planning phase for the Professional Docusaurus UI System, including:

1. Comprehensive research document covering:
   - Technical context and current architecture
   - Theme system implementation approaches
   - Component customization methods
   - Search enhancement strategies
   - Responsive design considerations
   - Performance optimization techniques

2. Detailed data model for:
   - Theme state management
   - Module navigation data
   - Search configuration and results

   - Performance contracts
   - Accessibility contracts
   - Responsive design contracts

4. Full implementation plan with:
   - 4 phases (Outline & Research, Design & Contracts, Implementation, Testing & Validation)
   - Detailed task breakdowns with checklists
   - Success criteria (quantitative and qualitative)
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Dependencies mapping

5. Quickstart guide for implementation team covering:
   - Environment setup
   - Theme configuration
   - Component customization
   - Testing and validation procedures

6. Agent context file created to maintain state across sessions

All technical requirements have been researched, designed, and documented. No "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items remain. The implementation plan is ready for execution with clear, testable tasks organized in phases.

## Outcome

The planning phase for the Professional Docusaurus UI System is complete. All design decisions have been documented, technical approaches validated, and implementation tasks defined. The project is ready to move to the implementation phase following the detailed plan. All deliverables have been created and follow the spec-driven development methodology.
