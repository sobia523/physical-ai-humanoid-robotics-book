## Prompt


## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive task list for the RAG Pipeline feature with 43 specific tasks organized across 6 phases. The tasks follow the proper format with sequential IDs, story labels, and parallelization markers. Tasks are organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3) with setup and foundational tasks first, followed by implementation phases for each user story, and ending with polish and cross-cutting concerns.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task breakdown with 43 specific, actionable tasks for RAG pipeline implementation
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation of tasks starting with Phase 1
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are organized by priority and dependencies to enable efficient development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Start implementation with Phase 1 setup tasks
