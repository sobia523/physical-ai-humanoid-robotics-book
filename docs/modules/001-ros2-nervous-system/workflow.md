# Content Creation Workflow and Review Process

## Content Creation Workflow

1. **Research Phase**
   - Gather credible sources (minimum 5 per chapter)
   - Verify technical accuracy against official documentation
   - Document sources in APA format

2. **Drafting Phase**
   - Follow the standardized chapter template
   - Maintain Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12 readability
   - Include functional code examples with detailed comments
   - Ensure content is between 1000-1500 words per chapter

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Test all code examples in ROS 2 environment
   - Validate URDF models in simulation
   - Verify all hands-on exercises are reproducible

4. **Review Phase**
   - Peer review for technical accuracy
   - Content clarity and readability check
   - Constitution compliance verification

## Review Process

### Self-Review Checklist
- [ ] Technical content verified against official sources
- [ ] All code examples functional and properly commented
- [ ] Minimum 5 credible sources cited in APA format per chapter
- [ ] Content meets 1000-1500 word count requirement
- [ ] Flesch-Kincaid grade level maintained (10-12)
- [ ] All claims traceable to credible sources
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

### Peer Review Requirements
- Technical accuracy verification by domain expert
- Code example validation in test environment
- Content clarity assessment for target audience

## Quality Gates

Before content is considered complete:
- All code examples must run successfully in test environment
- URDF models must load correctly in simulation
- Exercises must demonstrate reproducible results
- Content must pass constitution compliance check
