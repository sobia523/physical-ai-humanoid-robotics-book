# Content Validation Checklist Based on Constitution Requirements

## Purpose

This checklist ensures all content for the ROS 2 Nervous System module meets the project constitution requirements for accuracy, clarity, reproducibility, integration, and modern deployment standards.

## Constitution Compliance Validation

### Accuracy Requirements

- [ ] Code examples tested and confirmed functional
- [ ] URDF definitions conform to specification standards
- [ ] All claims about ROS 2 functionality traceable to credible sources
- [ ] All sources are credible (official documentation, peer-reviewed, authoritative textbooks)

### Clarity Requirements
- [ ] Content maintains Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12 readability
- [ ] All code examples include explanatory comments
- [ ] Complex concepts broken down with clear examples
- [ ] Technical terminology defined and used consistently
- [ ] Writing is clear and understandable for target audience (students and professionals)

### Reproducibility Requirements
- [ ] All code examples are ready-to-run with clear setup instructions
- [ ] Simulation environments properly configured as documented
- [ ] Examples tested in target environment
- [ ] Step-by-step instructions detailed and accurate
- [ ] Exercises demonstrate reproducible results in simulation

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] Content aligns with overall book structure
- [ ] Examples work within Docusaurus documentation system
- [ ] Code compatible with specified ROS 2 versions (Humble Hawksbill)
