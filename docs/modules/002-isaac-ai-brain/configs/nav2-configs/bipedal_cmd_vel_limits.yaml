# Bipedal Command Velocity Limits Configuration
# This file defines velocity limits specifically for bipedal humanoid robots
# accounting for balance, stability, and step planning constraints

# Linear velocity limits (m/s)
max_linear_velocity_x: 0.5      # Forward/backward speed limited for stability
min_linear_velocity_x: -0.3     # Backward speed limited for stability
max_linear_velocity_y: 0.0      # No lateral movement for bipedal
min_linear_velocity_y: 0.0      # No lateral movement for bipedal

# Angular velocity limits (rad/s)
max_angular_velocity_z: 0.4     # Limited for balance during turns
min_angular_velocity_z: -0.4    # Limited for balance during turns

# Acceleration limits (m/s^2 or rad/s^2)
max_linear_acceleration_x: 2.5  # Acceleration limited for stability
max_linear_deceleration_x: -2.5 # Deceleration limited for stability
max_linear_acceleration_y: 0.0  # No lateral acceleration for bipedal
max_angular_acceleration_z: 3.2 # Angular acceleration limited for balance

# Jerk limits (rate of change of acceleration)
max_linear_jerk_x: 5.0          # Limited for smooth motion
max_angular_jerk_z: 6.4         # Limited for smooth turning

# Additional bipedal-specific constraints
min_turn_radius: 0.3            # Minimum turning radius for bipedal stability
step_size: 0.2                  # Typical step size for humanoid locomotion
max_step_height: 0.1            # Maximum step height over obstacles
